Pheanstalk
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pda/pheanstalk.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pda/pheanstalk)

Pheanstalk is a pure PHP 5.2+ client for the [beanstalkd workqueue][1].  It has
been actively developed, and used in production by many, since late 2008.

Created by [Paul Annesley][2], Pheanstalk is rigorously unit tested and written
using encapsulated, maintainable object oriented design.  Community feedback,
bug reports and patches has led to a stable 1.0.0 release in 2010, and a 2.0.0
release in 2013.

beanstalkd up to the latest version 1.4 is supported.  All commands and
responses specified in the [protocol documentation][3] for beanstalkd 1.3 are
implemented.

Declare pheanstalk as a dependency in your projects `composer.json` file:

``` json
{
  "require": {
    "pda/pheanstalk": "dev-master"

```php
<?php

// If you aren't using composer, register Pheanstalk class loader
require_once('pheanstalk_init.php');

$pheanstalk = new Pheanstalk_Pheanstalk('127.0.0.1');

// ----------------------------------------
// producer (queues jobs)

$pheanstalk
  ->useTube('testtube')
  ->put("job payload goes here\n");

// ----------------------------------------
// worker (performs jobs)

$job = $pheanstalk
  ->watch('testtube')
  ->ignore('default')
  ->reserve();

echo $job->getData();

$pheanstalk->delete($job);

// ----------------------------------------
// check server availability

$pheanstalk->getConnection()->isServiceListening(); // true or false

```

Running the tests
-----------------

We use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to install [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/index.html), and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to create, and provision, an isolated test enviroment to run the tests in.

```
$ composer install --dev
$ cd tests/env
$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
$ php /vagrant/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit.php -c /vagrant/phpunit.xml.dist

Configuration read from /vagrant/phpunit.xml.dist
